# Blood_Delivery_Optimization
In the BC blood distribution network, an emergency or stat order can come from any location at any time. Mathematical modeling can be used to determine where the hospital site should draw from when blood is needed quickly. The Northern Health Authority of BC has the unique characteristics of a large geographical area, small population, and the possibility of temperamental weather. With small staffing, limited flights, and possible storm delays, ground transportation is usually the fastest mode of transport in an emergency. Linear programming can be used to optimize the transportation problem and get the optimal solution to the objective function of minimizing the time to meet the demand. The Microsoft Excel Solver tool allows for manual inputs and a robust and simplified result. Since weather and traffic delays can occur, weighted cost Pareto solutions for multiple objectives will be analyzed to see how real-time traffic data affects the distribution. Our model solves the objective function and indicates which hospital sites should supply to meet the demand of a stat order in the Northern Health Authority. By changing manual inputs, one can also determine optimal routing for redistribution.
